<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

PyLearn implements machine learning features from scratch.
It supports basic features of supervised and unsupervised learning.
<br />
<br />
You can
- create neural networks with dense layers, different activation functions and loss functions,
- save your trained network to the storage and evaluate its performance,
- cluster your data without knowing classes before,
- visualize the decision
- classify data
- and more

<br />
